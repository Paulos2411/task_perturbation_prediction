        description: |
          The primary name for the (parent) compound (in a standardized representation)
          as chosen by LINCS. This is provided to map the data in this experiment to 
          the LINCS Connectivity Map data.

          The global LINCS ID (parent) compound (in a standardized representation).
          This is provided to map the data in this experiment to the LINCS Connectivity
          Map data.

        description: |
          Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) representations of the
          compounds used in the experiment. This is a 1D representation of molecular
          structure. These SMILES are provided by Cellarity based on the specific
          compounds ordered for this experiment.

        description: |
          Differential expression value (-log10(p-value) * sign(LFC)) for each gene.
          Here, LFC is the estimated log-fold change in expression between the treatment
          and control condition after shrinkage as calculated by Limma. Positive LFC means
          the gene goes up in the treatment condition relative to the control.
